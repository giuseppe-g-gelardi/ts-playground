# TS-base

### basically a base typescript project ready to go. 

I was tired of starting a new typescript project from scratch each time i had
an i idea i wanted to test

## To get started:
1. https://github.com/giuseppe-g-gelardi/ts-base.git
2. cd ts-base
3. pnpm install
4. pnpm dev

### *"hey ts"* 
(...and a bunch of other witchcraft) should appear in the console

enjoy.
